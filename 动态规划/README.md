How should I explain dynamic programming to a 4-year-old?

*writes down "1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 ="on a sheet of paper*
"What&'s that equal to?"
*counting* "Eight!"*
writes down another "1+"on the left*
"What about that?"
*quickly* "Nine!"
"How&'d you know it was nine so fast?"
"You just added one more"
"So you didn&'t need to recount because you remembered there were eight!
Dynamic Programming </i>is just a fancy way to say &'remembering stuff to save time later"



这其实就是最简单的动态规划，解决的思路就是自底向上挨个突破，最终向上合成解决最终问题。
但是判断一个问题是不是动态规划问题要有一个普适,你能将最大的问题f(n)拆解成可以递推的有限个数的可求解子问题。


区别： 我觉得和递归的区别就在于，解决的方式一个是自底向上，一个是自顶向下。
